This project is built with Meteor.js framework, most functionality is broken down by directories
Since the scope was constantly changing, the code may not be organized very well
Froala video upload is in client/lib/froala-video-upload.js
Common modules are in client/dashboard
Design was changed in the middle, so there might be some traces of older templates and CSS
There might be some extra publish methods for the same reason
