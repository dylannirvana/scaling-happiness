Notes on selfie-new.js

I am not familiar with this API. According to MDN, Mozilla Developer Network, the navigator.getUserMedia protocol is deprecated, and would take some time to build it from scratch.

Working with the devices CAMERA can be a danger-zone. As I received this file, the camera DID NOT TURN OFF. I hacked at it for several hours and put the question up on StackOverflow but have yet to have received a satisfactory answer.
